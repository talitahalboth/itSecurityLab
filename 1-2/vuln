| ssl-dh-params: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Insufficient Group Strength
|     State: VULNERABLE
|       Transport Layer Security (TLS) services that use Diffie-Hellman groups of
|       insufficient strength, especially those using one of a few commonly shared
|       groups, may be susceptible to passive eavesdropping attacks.
|     Check results:
|       WEAK DH GROUP 1
|             Cipher Suite: TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA
|             Modulus Type: Safe prime
|             Modulus Source: Unknown/Custom-generated
|             Modulus Length: 1024
|             Generator Length: 8
|             Public Key Length: 1024

| ssl-heartbleed: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   The Heartbleed Bug is a serious vulnerability in the popular OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows for stealing information intended to be protected by SSL/TLS encryption.
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     Risk factor: High
|       OpenSSL versions 1.0.1 and 1.0.2-beta releases (including 1.0.1f and 1.0.2-beta1) of OpenSSL are affected by the Heartbleed bug. The bug allows for reading memory of systems protected by the vulnerable OpenSSL versions and could allow for disclosure of otherwise encrypted confidential information as well as the encryption keys themselves.

| ssl-poodle: 
|   VULNERABLE:
|   SSL POODLE information leak
|     State: VULNERABLE
|     IDs:  OSVDB:113251  CVE:CVE-2014-3566
|           The SSL protocol 3.0, as used in OpenSSL through 1.0.1i and
|           other products, uses nondeterministic CBC padding, which makes it easier
|           for man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain cleartext data via a
|           padding-oracle attack, aka the "POODLE" issue.
|     Disclosure date: 2014-10-14
|     Check results:
|       TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
