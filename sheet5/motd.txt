Infinitely many mathematicians walk into a bar.
The first says, "I'll have a beer."
The second says, "I'll have half a beer."
The third says, "I'll have a quarter of a beer."
The barman pulls out just two beers.
The mathematicians are all like, "That's all you're giving us? How drunk do you expect us to get on that?"
The bartender says, "Come on guys. Know your limits."
